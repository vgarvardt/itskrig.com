It was not surprise for me that latest stable, 11 for now, MS Internet Explorer does not support date input type. But I was shocked by the fact that the latest stable FireFox version, 25 for now, does not support it too! Actually, the only browser that does is Chromium. And of course browsers based on Chromium - [Google Chrome and Opera](http://caniuse.com/input-datetime).
