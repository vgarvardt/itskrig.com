Optimisation vs Complexity

general thoughts, complexity

Optimised one of the processes for x10 performance boost and I really do not like it: instead of simple straightforward
logic now I have async operation with channels, buffers, timeouts, etc. I wish I could simply throw some money/hardware
into it instead of complexity increase.
